# Ionospheric Collective Thomson Scatter Demo

The demo comes with 20 seconds of Arecibo Observatory 430 MHz raw voltage data sampled at 25 MHz sample-rate. 10 seconds of uncoded long pulse and 10 seconds of coded long pulse data is included. This data allows observing a plasma-line profile as well as the ion-line profile. The coded long pulse provides high range and Doppler resolution, and the uncoded long pulse provides high SNR for top-side observations.

Obtain the data through Zenodo:
